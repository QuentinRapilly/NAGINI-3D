# NAGINI-3D | Prediction of Parametric Surfaces for Multi-Object Segmentation in 3D Biological Imaging

We present NAGINI-3D (N-Active shapes for seGmentINg 3D biological Images), a method dedicated to 3D biological images segmentation, based on both deep learning (CNN) and Active Surfaces (Snakes).

## Method description

Our approach consists in training a U-Net to:
1. locate the objects of interest in an 3D image using a probability map,
2. for each object, predict a set of control points describing a parametric surface representing the object,
3. (optionnal) a snake optimisation procedure based on image gradient can be used to optimize the surfaces.

To evaluate the loss used to train the network, the probability map and a sampling representing each object of the training dataset are required. Some tools available in this Github will help you pre-process you data to create them.
