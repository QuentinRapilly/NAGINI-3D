# NAGINI-3D | Prediction of Parametric Surfaces for Multi-Object Segmentation in 3D Biological Imaging

We present NAGINI-3D (N-Active shapes for seGmentINg 3D biological Images), a method dedicated to 3D biological images segmentation, based on both deep learning (CNN) and Active Surfaces (Snakes).
